# !!!Color finder !!!

## Description

!!!currently my program will go though each pixel and display the rgb value as a single unit then display red green and blue seperatly so its easier for people who dont understand programing to understand it better.!!!

### v0.2 Updates

*Coming soon*

### v1.0 Updates

*Coming soon*


## Developer

!!!Matthew Butcher!!!

## Example

To run the program, give the following commands:

```
g++ --std=c++11 *.cpp -o cvp
./cvp
```

Here is an example of the program running:

```
!!!Replace with an example of the program running with user interaction

color(20,20,30)
Entered Red (20)
Entered Green(20)
Entered Blue(30)
!!!
```

## C++ Guide

### Variables and Data Types

!!!
i used int to represent the color levels of red green and blue because in a file those colors are represented by a number and the mixture of those numbers is how other colors are made.
i made two variables for future development so that its possible to compare two colors later


!!!

### Console Input and Output

!!!
for input i used quite a few, for starters i am having the user input a file. this is important since everyting is based on what file the user inputs. from there i am having the program input what the color pixel rgb values are.
!!!

### Decisions

!!!
i used a decisions by asking the user to input a file.
while not the biggest decision its still an important one.
future decisions might inclue wanting to look out for certain color mixes or even change colors.

!!!

### Iteration

!!!
for my program i am having having it run thought each pixel and having it then display the whole rgb value and a broken up value that is easier to understand. this will keep going for every line until it reaches the end of the image and then quites.
!!!

### File Input and Output

!!!

i am asking my program to use the inputed file and from there go though each pixel in the array and find the rgb values from there my program will display the total color value and break up that value into red green blue to be more understanable to those who dont know  programing.
